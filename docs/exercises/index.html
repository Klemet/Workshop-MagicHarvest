Harvest will go and harvest 70% all stands impacted by the fire (remember that a stand is a group of pixels in LANDIS-II). The prescription we will used called “salvage logging” will be pre-defined in the B. Harvest parameter text file, so we do not need to create it in the script. The rest of the harvesting for the current timestep will be left to B. Harvest to decide; so here, we do not take complete control.</p><p>Basically, that means that we are going to take the fire map created by one of the fire extensions of LANDIS-II; the management area map of B. Harvest; and we’re going to merge the two to create a new management area corresponding to the fire. Then, we’ll have to make sure that B. Harvest will harvest 70% of the surfaced of this new management area with the salvage logging prescription.</p></div></aside><details id="my-solution-exercise-1" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-gray-500/60"><summary class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-gray-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900 cursor-pointer hover:shadow-[inset_0_0_0px_30px_#00000003] dark:hover:shadow-[inset_0_0_0px_30px_#FFFFFF03]"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group">Solution to <span data-state="closed"><a href="#exercise-1" class="hover-link">Exercise <!-- -->1</a></span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#my-solution-exercise-1" title="Link to this Solution" aria-label="Link to this Solution"> #</a></div><div class="self-center flex-none text-sm font-thin text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none transition-transform details-toggle"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M16.28 11.47a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-7.5 7.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06-1.06L14.69 12 7.72 5.03a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06-1.06l7.5 7.5Z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></div></summary><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4 details-body"><p>Here is the resulting algorithm in plain english to write a script that will do this with Magic Harvest.</p><p>The solution here is relatively simple, because we’re letting Biomass Harvest take a lot of decisions.</p><p><img id="vYceZYVU9R" style="margin:0 auto" src="https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-MagicHarvest//build/Slide31-1e23992b91a4ee79c36c1ac433aea32d.jpg" data-canonical-url="./images/Slide31.jpg" class=""/></p><ul><li><p>Read latest fire map</p></li><li><p>Edit the management area map to create a new one on the disturbance</p></li><li><p>Edit the biomass harvest parameter file to make sure it will read the new map and edit its implementation table to add a new line to harvest 70% of the stands or of the surface of the new management area</p></li></ul></div></details><h2 id="second-exercise-clearcutting-partial-cutting-and-protected-areas" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Second exercise - Clearcutting, Partial cutting and protected areas</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#second-exercise-clearcutting-partial-cutting-and-protected-areas" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><aside id="exercise-2" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-blue-500/60"><div class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-blue-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none hover:underline" href="#exercise-2" title="Link to this Exercise" aria-label="Link to this Exercise">Exercise<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></div></div><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4"><p><img id="msTwbOBuur" style="margin:0 auto" src="https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-MagicHarvest//build/Slide32-818413efb3be3d22de50ee0c38cb1416.jpg" data-canonical-url="./images/Slide32.jpg" class=""/></p><p>We want to harvest with clearcutting and partial cutting until we reach a target of biomass.

We will prioritize stands with the most biomass in them, but we will avoid stands located in protected areas.</p><p>So, we’re going to read the stands in the landscapes; define a biomass target (it doesn’t matter the number, just know that we have one); we’re going to rank the stands, and then select stands with clearcutting or partial cutting until 70% of the biomass target is harvested with clearcutting, and 30% with partial cutting. And of course, we’ll be mindful of the protected areas.</p><p>This one is going to be much more complex since we’re taking complete control of what pixels will be harvested exactly. Take your time; you will surely encounter problems as you go forwards, for which you will have to go back and edit the beginning of your algorithm to get things ready for the rest.</p></div></aside><details id="my-solution-exercise-2" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-gray-500/60"><summary class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-gray-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900 cursor-pointer hover:shadow-[inset_0_0_0px_30px_#00000003] dark:hover:shadow-[inset_0_0_0px_30px_#FFFFFF03]"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group">Solution to <span data-state="closed"><a href="#exercise-2" class="hover-link">Exercise <!-- -->2</a></span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#my-solution-exercise-2" title="Link to this Solution" aria-label="Link to this Solution"> #</a></div><div class="self-center flex-none text-sm font-thin text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none transition-transform details-toggle"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M16.28 11.47a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-7.5 7.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06-1.06L14.69 12 7.72 5.03a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06-1.06l7.5 7.5Z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></div></summary><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4 details-body"><ul><li>Read the position of the stands and their composition in terms of vegetation/age cohorts and their biomass</li><li>Read the location of protected areas, and create an object that defines if a stand is in a protected area or not</li><li>Read or define in the script how clearcutting and partial cutting are done so that we can estimate the biomass harvested when we apply it to a - stand</li><li>Prepare an empty management map filled with zeroes</li><li>Define the overall biomass target</li><li>Harvest 70% with clearcutting :<ul><li>Rank the stand in the landscape based on their biomass</li><li>Create a list of stands harvested with clearcutting</li><li>Add stands to the clearcutting list one by one in ranking order<ul><li>Check everytime if a stand is in a protected area.

But in a random 20% of the stands that we will harvest with clearcutting, we will do enrichment planting and add 2 rare species in the stand. We will add distribute these 2 rare species randomly in the cells of the stand, 1 species per cell. These rare species will be chosen based on the composition of the cell : we have a table giving us the priority for planting each of them. But if the rare species is already in the stand, then we will not plant it and choose another of lower priority. We will just do clearcutting to keep things simple, and nothing else. No partial cutting this time. No protected areas either.</p><p>So, like before, we would look at the stands in the landscape, take a biomass target, rank the stands, select stands for harvest with clearcutting until we reach the biomass target; then, we will select 20% of all stands harvested randomly, select 2 rare species to plant, and plant these species randomly in the stand, with one species planted by pixel. And so, we are going to need special prescription of clearcutting + planting because remember : B. Harvest can only do one type of planting by prescription. B. Harvest cannot vary the planting or do conditional planting for one prescription. So here, we have to prepare this for B.Harvest so that they know what to do.</p><p>This is basically what I’ve done in a recent paper (see <cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">Hardy et al. 2025</a></cite>), albeit a little different.</p></div></aside><details id="my-solution-exercise-3" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-gray-500/60"><summary class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-gray-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900 cursor-pointer hover:shadow-[inset_0_0_0px_30px_#00000003] dark:hover:shadow-[inset_0_0_0px_30px_#FFFFFF03]"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group">Solution to <span data-state="closed"><a href="#exercise-3" class="hover-link">Exercise <!-- -->3</a></span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#my-solution-exercise-3" title="Link to this Solution" aria-label="Link to this Solution"> #</a></div><div class="self-center flex-none text-sm font-thin text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-200"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none transition-transform details-toggle"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M16.28 11.47a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-7.5 7.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06-1.06L14.69 12 7.72 5.03a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06-1.06l7.5 7.5Z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></div></summary><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4 details-body"><p><img id="epdH6unFBC" style="margin:0 auto" src="https://klemet.github.io/Workshop-MagicHarvest//build/Slide36-7041c2c072a62c9174520dee781480e2.jpg" data-canonical-url="./images/Slide36.jpg" class=""/></p><ul><li>Read the position of the stands and their composition in terms of vegetation/age cohorts and their biomass</li><li>Read the location of protected areas, and create an object that defines if a stand is in a protected area or not</li><li>Read or define in the script how clearcutting is done so that we can estimate the biomass harvested when we apply it to a stand</li><li>Prepare an empty management map filled with zeroes</li><li>Prepare an object to record new clearcutting prescription with different types of planting following the clearcut.</li><li>Define the overall biomass target</li><li>Select the stands to harvest :<ul><li>Rank all of the stands in the landscape according to their biomass.</li><li>We add the stands one by one in their ranking order to the list of stands harvested with clearcutting for the timestep.<ul><li>For each stand, we compute the biomass that clearcutting will harvest and we compute the sum.</li></ul></li><li>We stop when we have reached the biomass target.</li></ul></li><li>We select 20% of stands randomly in the list of stand harvested with clearcutting.<ul><li>For the 80% not selected, we input the code for simple clearcutting (without planting) in the empty management map.</li><li>For the 20% selected for planting, we look at stands one by one.<ul><li>We select the 2 species to plant by looking at the composition of the stand and our priority list for planting.</li><li>Once the 2 species are selected, we check if clearcutting prescription with a planting of one of these 2 species already exist in our object to -
