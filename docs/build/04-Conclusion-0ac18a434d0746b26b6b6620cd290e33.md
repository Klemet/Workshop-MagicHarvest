Thank you for taking the time to learn to use Magic Harvest ! I hope it'll be as useful to you as it was to me.

You might think that this workshop is strangely detailed and complete for such a small extension of a single Forest Landscape Model. Truth is, I had a lot of colleagues and people in the LANDIS-II community asking me about Magic Harvest; and so, I decided to make sure that everybody had a good ressource to learn how to use it in the future.

As forest ecologists, we are now in great demand to investigate the long-term and large scale effect of forest management. Forest industries, governments and the public at large are desperate to find new ways to do forestry without compromising the health, integrity and complexity of forests.

Now, you have an incredible opportunity to do research that has never been seen before !
