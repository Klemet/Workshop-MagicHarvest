## Thinking about what you can do with Magic Harvest

The three exercices that I propose here will not ask you to code in any programming langage.

What I'm going to do is ask you to write step-by-step algorithms in plain english about what a possible script used with Magic Harvest (whatever the programming langage you choose down the road) will be used for different use case.

In that way, when you'll try to use Magic Harvest for your own research, I hope that you'll have a general idea of what you'll want to do with it. The implementation of your algorithm in a programming - the coding part - is not necesseraly the most complex thing to do, especially with the new AI tools that are accessible today.

## Example of an algorithm in plain english

Here is an example of the kind of algorithm I propose that you'll write in the following exercises, in plain english.
