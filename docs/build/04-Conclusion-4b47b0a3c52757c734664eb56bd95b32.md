Thank you for taking the time to learn to use Magic Harvest ! I hope it'll be as useful to you as it was to me.

You might think that this workshop is strangely detailed and complete for such a small extension of a single Forest Landscape Model. 

Now, you have an incredible opportunity to do research that has never been seen before !
