## Thinking about what you can do with Magic Harvest

The three exercices that I propose here will not ask you to code in any programming langage.

What I'm going to do is ask you to write step-by-step algorithms in plain english about what a possible script used with Magic Harvest (whatever the programming langage you choose down the road) will be used.
